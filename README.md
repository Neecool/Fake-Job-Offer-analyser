🔹 1. Introduction
With the rapid rise in cybercrimes targeting job seekers, fake job offer scams have become a widespread threat — especially among fresh graduates and early-career professionals. These fraudulent offers often impersonate well-known companies and manipulate victims into sharing personal information or paying upfront "security" or "processing" fees.
The Fake Job Offer Analyzer is a browser-based tool designed to tackle this very problem. It allows users to paste job offer content into a text field, and instantly flags suspicious patterns based on OSINT logic, red flags, and scam behavior.

🔹 3. Problem Statement
Fake job offer scams:
•	Use convincing language & logos
•	Often originate from Gmail/Yahoo domains
•	Demand urgent action & upfront money
•	Trick users into submitting sensitive documents (Aadhar, PAN)
Despite growing awareness, many people still fall for these scams due to lack of verification tools.

🔹 7. Detection Logic Explained
The analyzer uses pattern-matching logic to detect:
•	Email red flags (e.g., @gmail.com for big companies)
•	Scam keywords (processing fee, refundable, urgent)
•	Fake document requests (Aadhar, PAN, passport)
•	Payment triggers (Bank account numbers, UPI IDs)
•	Urgency-based pressure (within 24 hours, immediate joining)
It doesn’t just highlight issues — it also educates the user by showing why a certain phrase or request is dangerous.

🔹 12. Final Thoughts

The Fake Job Offer Analyzer is a small but powerful step in that direction. I hope it not only helps job seekers but also spreads awareness in colleges and communities.
